    "## Part 1.1 Implementing your helper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To help train your naive bayes model, you will need to build a dictionary where the keys are a (word, label) tuple and the values are the corresponding frequency.  Note that the labels we'll use here are 1 for positive and 0 for negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also implement a `lookup()` helper function that takes in the `freqs` dictionary, a word, and a label (1 or 0) and returns the number of times that word and label tuple appears in the collection of tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: given a list of tweets `[\"i am rather excited\", \"you are rather happy\"]` and the label 1, the function will return a dictionary that contains the following key-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "    (\"rather\", 1): 2\n",
    "    (\"happi\", 1) : 1\n",
    "    (\"excit\", 1) : 1\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notice how for each word in the given string, the same label 1 is assigned to each word.\n",
    "- Notice how the words \"i\" and \"am\" are not saved, since it was removed by process_tweet because it is a stopword.\n",
    "- Notice how the word \"rather\" appears twice in the list of tweets, and so its count value is 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "Create a function `count_tweets()` that takes a list of tweets as input, cleans all of them, and returns a dictionary.\n",
    "- The key in the dictionary is a tuple containing the stemmed word and its class label, e.g. (\"happi\",1).\n",
    "- The value the number of times this word appears in the given collection of tweets (an integer)."
